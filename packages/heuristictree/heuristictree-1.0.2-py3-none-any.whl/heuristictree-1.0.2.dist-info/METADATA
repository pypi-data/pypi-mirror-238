Heuristic Methods for Minimizing Cut Bars and Using Leftovers from the One-dimensional Cutting Process - TREE Heuristic.

## Getting Started
#### Dependencies
You need Python 3.8 or later to use **heuristictree**. You can find it at [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

#### Installation
Clone this repo to your local machine using:
```
git clone https://github.com/omatheuspimenta/heuristictree.git
```
or
```p
pip install heuristictree
```

## Features
In this heuristic, the losses of the cutting process are concentrated on the smallest number of bars possible, using a tree structure, in order to become losses (unusable) into leftovers (usable). 

## Example
```python
from heuristictree import tree as ht

n = 7
L = 30
l = [7, 9, 11, 14, 19, 21, 26]
d = [2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1]

left = loss = bar = 0
x = []

left,loss,bar,x = ht.tree(L=L, n=n, l=l, d=d)
```
## Input and Parameters
* **L:** Size of bar to be cutting. _(int)_
* **l:** Lenght of items to be cutting. _(list)_
* **d:** Demand of items to be cutting. _(list)_
* **smallitem:** Size of small item. Default is the smallest item to be cutting. _(int)_

## Output 
* **left:** Leftover from the cutting process. _(int)_
* **loss:** Loss from the cutting process. _(int)_
* **bar:** Bar number used in the cutting process. _(int)_
* **x:** Cutting pattern. _(list)_
