    <br>
    An utility for adding new import paths to
    <br>
    make your relative <code>import</code> work without hassle.
    <br>
    <br>
    <pre>pip install <a href="https://github.com/hirsimaki-markus/importmonkey">importmonkey</a></pre>

## What does it do?
**Here is your repository:**
```
‚îú‚îÄ src
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ project
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ module.py
‚îî‚îÄ test
    ‚îî‚îÄ test.py
```

**test.py can't find module.py:**
```python
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'module'
ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
SystemError: Parent module '' not loaded, cannot perform relative import
```

**importmonkey will fix that:**

```python
from importmonkey import add_path  # In test.py
add_path("../src")
import project
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Why?
Sometimes you want a specific repo structure to test and build a package from the same
files so you need a relative / sibling / parent import.
