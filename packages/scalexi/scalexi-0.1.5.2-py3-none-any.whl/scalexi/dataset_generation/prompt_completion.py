def format_prompt_completion(prompt, completion, start_sequence="\n\n###\n\n", end_sequence="END"):
    """
    Formats a given prompt and its corresponding completion into a structured dictionary format.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This function is designed to take a user-defined prompt and its associated completion and format them into a structured sequence. By default, the function uses specific start and end sequences to encapsulate the prompt-completion pair, but these can be customized as needed. Such structured formatting is essential when working with datasets for large language models, ensuring uniformity and ease of processing.

    Parameters
    ----------
        prompt (str): 
            The primary text or question that requires a completion. This serves as the context for the model.
            
        completion (str): 
            The model's response or answer to the given prompt. It completes the information or context provided by the prompt.
            
        start_sequence (str, optional): 
            A sequence of characters that signifies the beginning of a new prompt-completion pair. It helps in demarcating different entries in a dataset. Defaults to "\\n\\n###\\n\\n".
            
        end_sequence (str, optional): 
            A sequence of characters that marks the end of a prompt-completion pair. Like the start sequence, it aids in distinguishing between different dataset entries. Defaults to "END".

    Returns
    -------
        dict: 
            A dictionary containing the formatted prompt and completion. This structured output can be directly used for dataset creation or other related tasks.

        This function facilitates the organization of a user-defined prompt and its corresponding completion into a structured pandas DataFrame. Such organization is especially beneficial when handling, analyzing, or storing large datasets for machine learning tasks, ensuring a uniform and easily accessible data structure.

        Parameters:
        ----------
            prompt (str): 
                The initial text or question that is presented to a model or system. It provides context or a scenario which requires a subsequent completion or answer.
                
            completion (str): 
                The subsequent text or response that corresponds to the prompt. It provides additional information or a resolution to the context given by the prompt.
                
            start_sequence (str, optional): 
                A sequence of characters that denotes the beginning of the prompt. It helps segment and recognize the start of a data entry in larger datasets. Defaults to "\\n\\n###\\n\\n".
                
            end_sequence (str, optional): 
                A sequence of characters that indicates the conclusion of the completion. It assists in segmenting and marking the end of a data entry in larger datasets. Defaults to "END".

        Returns:
        -------
