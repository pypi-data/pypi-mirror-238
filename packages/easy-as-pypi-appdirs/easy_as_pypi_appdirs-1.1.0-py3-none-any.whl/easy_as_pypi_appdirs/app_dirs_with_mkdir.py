    """Singleton AppDirs with ``mkdir`` side effect.

    - As a Singleton, this class can be instantiated and used without
      knowing the appname, provided some bootstrap code registers it.

      E.g., when the app is first loaded, have it call::

        first_instance = AppDirsWithMkdir(appname='my-awesome-app')

      and then, later, access the same instance by instantiating anew:

        user_data_dir = AppDirsWithMkdir().user_data_dir

    - Has a Side effect, which is that, just by querying a directory
      path, this class creates that path, or ensures it exists.

      The author (lb) isn't super jazzed by this "feature", but it
      was useful to get a downstream app up and running more easily
      without having to manage mkdir'ing application directories...
      and now it's been baked in so long I don't want to spend the
      time changing it... it's just something of which to be aware:

      - Asking for an application directory path may create that path.

    - Regarding Singleton (again), which is not the most respected
      pattern (some might say it's always a smell), consider this
      classic discussion on ways to implement Singleton in Python,
      and whether or not they're a good idea:
