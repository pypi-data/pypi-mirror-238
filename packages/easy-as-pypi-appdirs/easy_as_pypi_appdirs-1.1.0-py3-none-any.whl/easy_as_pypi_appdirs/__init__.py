# This version value is substituted on poetry-build. See pyproject.toml:
#   [tool.poetry-dynamic-versioning.substitution]
# - So when installed in 'editable' mode, the substitution does not happen,
#   and __version__ remains "".
#   - But we only use __version__ for .github/workflows/release-smoke-test.yml
#     and not for anything else (otherwise we could check Git tags when
#     __version__ == "", if we assume an 'editable' mode install only happens
#     on a dev machine).
__version__ = "1.1.0"
