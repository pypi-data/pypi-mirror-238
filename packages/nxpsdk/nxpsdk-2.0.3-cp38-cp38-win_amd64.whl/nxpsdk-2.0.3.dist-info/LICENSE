Realeyes OÜ
Vahe 15
11615 Tallinn
Estonia

Effective Date:
2023-09-7

Realeyes offers services provided by Realeyes OÜ (Vahe 15, Tallinn 11615, Estonia, registry
code: 11730664) and its affiliates (collectively "Realeyes," "us," "we," or "our").
These Special Terms of Service ("Special Terms") set out the terms on which Realeyes
provides Client (also referred to as ‘you’, ‘your’ or ‘user’) its software, application, and other
products and services ("Services"). By using the Services, Client agrees to be bound by these
Special Terms, including all other terms and policies incorporated herein by reference, and
enters into a legally binding agreement with Realeyes ("Agreement").
The Services are governed by two separate but complementary sets of terms: the Terms of
Service ("General Terms") and these Special Terms. By using the Services, Client agrees to
comply with both sets of terms. If there is a conflict or inconsistency between the General
Terms and the Special Terms, the provisions of the Special Terms shall supersede and take
precedence over the conflicting or inconsistent provisions in the General Terms.
If the Client is utilizing the Services on behalf of an organization, the Client represents that
they have the authority to bind such organization to this Agreement. The terms "Client" and
"user" will encompass the individual user and the respective organization. Should the Client
not concur with these terms in full, they are advised not to use our Services. Client and
Realeyes are referred to herein individually as a "Party" and jointly as the "Parties".
## 1. Services Description
Realeyes has developed proprietary online Software as a Service (“SaaS”) providing computer
vision capabilities. The Services provided by Realeyes through this SaaS include:
### 1.1 XP Attention & Emotion
The market-leading Vision AI (Artificial Intelligence) models offered by Realeyes are of
premier quality and lightweight, designed to operate locally on the client-side subsequent to a
methodical integration into Clients host application. Upon securing the user's consent, our
Software Development Kit (“SDK”) activates the webcam feed, analyzing images at a rate of
up to 32 frames per second. This subsequently captures five measurements every second,
gauging users' likelihood of manifesting Attention and several emotion classifiers. Data, in
real-time, is provisioned on the client-side for the host application's benefit. Concurrently,
near-real-time data is relayed to the cloud or other specified endpoints utilizing a
publisher/subscriber architecture.
### 1.2 XP Identity
The XP Identity service employs our premier Vision AI models, designed to function either
locally on the client-side or within the cloud, safeguarded behind a secure API endpoint. Upon
obtaining user consent, the SDK activates the webcam feed, seizes an image, and channels it
through Realeyes' proprietary Vision AI. This procedure calculates a user's distinct facial
embedding. Such embedding can then be juxtaposed against a pre-existing user set for
authentication purposes and to discern any duplications. Furthermore, XP Identity possesses
the capability to identify bots, potential demographic discrepancies via age/gender
assessments, and attempts at presentation or injection attacks wherein users strive to elude
verification.
These SaaS solutions are collectively referred to herein as “Software”. For the Software to
work as intended and engage its full potential, Realeyes requests Client’s permission to use
the front-facing or secondary camera on its device. Realeyes does not store video or images
from camera on Client’s device or systems, servers or cloud storage. Only binary outputs of
the data derived from video or images are sent to Realeyes’ servers. Any images accessed
from the camera will be discarded immediately after processing it on Client’s device, where
such technical processing should not take longer than one second at most. For more
information about controls over the data, please refer to Realeyes Privacy Policy.
## 2. License, restrictions and prohibited use
Realeyes hereby grants Client a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to access and
use the Services.
Client shall not, and shall not permit any third party to: (a) modify, adapt, or create derivative
works based on the Services. For the purposes of this Agreement, "modify" means to change,
edit, adapt, translate, decompile, or otherwise alter the Software or any of its components,
including but not limited to its source code, logic, algorithms, layout, and user interface.; (b)
sublicense, rent, lease, loan, or otherwise transfer the Services or any rights granted herein;
(c) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code

Services; (e) sell, resell or commercially use the Services or (f) use the Services other than for
their intended purpose and in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect

overburden or impair the functioning of the Services in any manner.
## 3. User Data and ownership

Third-party applications that Client share and create by using our Services (collectively

with Client on the camera feed of the given Third-party application; (ii) Realeyes’ use of such

Software or any related intellectual property, except for the limited license expressly granted
