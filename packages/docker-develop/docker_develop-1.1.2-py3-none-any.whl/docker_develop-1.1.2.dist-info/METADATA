# Docker-Develop

Docker-Develop is a versatile utility tool designed to simplify the management of Docker Compose configurations and make your container orchestration tasks smoother than ever. It empowers you to effortlessly work with distributed `docker-compose.yml` files scattered across multiple repositories and directories, providing a unified and efficient approach to containerized development.

## Key Features

- **Parameterized Docker Compose**: Docker-Develop streamlines the usage of `docker-compose`, ensuring the right parameters are applied based on your selections.
- **Dependency Management**: Define dependencies between configurations, enabling you to control the order in which `docker-compose.yml` files are passed to Docker Compose.
- **Environment Variable Overrides**: Customize your configurations by overriding environment variables through dependencies.
- **Docker Compose Profiles**: Seamlessly work with Docker Compose profiles to meet your specific development needs.
- **Secrets Vault**: Built-in support for securely storing sensitive information, such as environment variables, certificates, and more. All securely managed as password-protected zip files.

## Getting Started

Docker-Develop offers a wide range of commands to help you manage your Docker Compose configurations effectively. Here are some of the core commands to get you started:
