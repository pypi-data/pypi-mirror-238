You need to install the tool as a python package
```
pip3 install send_steps
```

## How to use it
### Install dependencies
First you need to install all dependencies from the steps and custom type files, which you want to upload on the website.

### run the script
Then you can use the script, either directly from the folder with the steps or you can provide the path to the steps folder. And you need to provide the link to the repository, something like this:
```
send-steps https://code.roche.com/example/example
```
