Graph Optimization and Learning by Evolutionary Methods
-------------------------------------------------------

GOLEM is an open-source AI framework for optimization and learning of structured graph-based models with meta-heuristic
methods. It is centered around 2 ideas:

1. The potential of meta-heuristic methods in complex problem spaces.

The focus on meta-heuristics allows approaching the kinds of problems where gradient-based learning methods (notably, neural networks)
can't be easily applied, like optimization problems with multiple conflicting objectives or having a combinatorial nature.

2. The importance of structured models in multiple problem domains.

Graph-based learning enables solutions in the form of structured and hybrid probabilistic models, not to mention
that a wide range of domain-specific problems have a natural formulation in the form of graphs.

Together this constitutes an approach to AI that potentially leads to structured, intuitive, interpretable methods and
solutions for a wide range of tasks.


Core Features
=============

- **Structured** models with joint optimization of graph structure and properties (node attributes).
- **Metaheuristic** methods (mainly evolutionary) applicable to any task with a well-defined objective.
- **Multi-objective** optimization that can take into account both quality and complexity.
- **Constrained** optimization with support for arbitrary domain-specific constraints.
- **Extensible** to new domains.
- **Interpretable** thanks to meta-heuristics, structured models, and visualisation tools.
- **Reproducible** thanks to rich optimization history and model serialization.


Applications
============

GOLEM is potentially applicable to any optimization problem structures:

- that can be represented as directed graphs;
- that have some clearly defined fitness function on them.

Graph models can represent fixed structures (e.g. physical models such as truss structures) or functional models that
define a data-flow or inference process (e.g. bayesian networks that can be fitted and queried).

Examples of GOLEM applications:

- Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML) with optimal ML pipelines search in `FEDOT framework <https://github.com/aimclub/FEDOT>`_
- Bayesian network structure search in `BAMT framework <https://github.com/aimclub/BAMT>`_
- Differential equation discovery for physical models in `EPDE framework <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/EPDE>`_
- Geometric design of physical objects in `GEFEST framework <https://github.com/aimclub/GEFEST>`_
- `Neural architecture search <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/nas-fedot>`_

As GOLEM is a general-purpose framework, it's easy to imagine potential applications, for example, finite state automata search
for robotics control or molecular graph learning for drug discovery, and more.


Installation
============

GOLEM can be installed with ``pip``:

.. code-block::

  $ pip install thegolem


Quick Start Example
===================

Following example demonstrates graph search using reference graph & edit distance metric. Optimizer is set up with a minimal set of parameters and simple single-point mutations. For more details see examples `simple_run.py <https://github.com/aimclub/GOLEM/blob/main/examples/synthetic_graph_evolution/simple_run.py>`_, `graph_search.py <https://github.com/aimclub/GOLEM/blob/main/examples/synthetic_graph_evolution/graph_search.py>`_ and `tree_search.py <https://github.com/aimclub/GOLEM/blob/main/examples/synthetic_graph_evolution/tree_search.py>`_ in directory `examples/synthetic_graph_evolution <https://github.com/aimclub/GOLEM/tree/main/examples/synthetic_graph_evolution>`_.

.. code-block:: python

    def run_graph_search(size=16, timeout=8):
        # Generate target graph sought by optimizer using edit distance objective
        node_types = ('a', 'b')  # Available node types that can appear in graphs
        target_graph = generate_labeled_graph('tree', size, node_types)
        objective = Objective(partial(tree_edit_dist, target_graph))
        initial_population = [generate_labeled_graph('tree', 5, node_types) for _ in range(10)]

        # Setup optimization parameters
        requirements = GraphRequirements(timeout=timedelta(minutes=timeout))
        gen_params = GraphGenerationParams(adapter=BaseNetworkxAdapter(), available_node_types=node_types)
        algo_params = GPAlgorithmParameters(pop_size=30)

        # Build and run the optimizer
        optimiser = EvoGraphOptimizer(objective, initial_population, requirements, gen_params, algo_params)
        found_graphs = optimiser.optimise(objective)

        # Visualize results
        found_graph = gen_params.adapter.restore(found_graphs[0])  # Transform back to NetworkX graph
        draw_graphs_subplots(target_graph, found_graph, titles=['Target Graph', 'Found Graph'])
        optimiser.history.show.fitness_line()
        return found_graph
