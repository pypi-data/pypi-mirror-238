# Introduction

I created this repo to easily translate English and Turkish words by using very good project, [Tureng](https://tureng.com/en/turkish-english).

This CLI basically scrapes [https://tureng.com/en/turkish-english](https://tureng.com/en/turkish-english) link to parse translation results. You can just pass the word as a parameter to translate.

# Installation

You can easily start using the CLI by installing it as a package on your Python environment.

```bash
pip install .
```

Or you can install it by using the command below

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/BaysanSoft/Tureng-Translation-CLI.git
```

Or you can just use `sudo make install`.

## Install As a Bash Script

If you want to use it from bash, you can just move [tureng-cli.sh](tureng-cli.sh) to `/usr/sbin/`.

**!With this kind of installation, you can use `translate` command for default.**

```bash
>>> sudo mv tureng-cli.sh /usr/sbin/
>>> turenh-cli.sh "hurricane"
