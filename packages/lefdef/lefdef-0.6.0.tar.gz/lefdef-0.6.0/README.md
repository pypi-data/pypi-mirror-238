# LEFDEF Python

This repository provides a Python interface to parse LEF (Library Exchange Format) and DEF (Design Exchange Format) files.

## Install

You can install library using pip


```bash
pip install lefdef
```

## Usage

To use the LEF reader, you can follow the example provided in the `test.py` file:

```python
from lefdef import C_LefReader
from lefdef import C_DefReader

lef_reader = C_LefReader()
_lef = lef_reader.read("/path/to/lef/file.lef")
_lef.print()

def_reader = C_DefReader()
_def = def_reader.read("/path/to/def/file.def")
_def.print()
```

It will read and print all information that have been read.
