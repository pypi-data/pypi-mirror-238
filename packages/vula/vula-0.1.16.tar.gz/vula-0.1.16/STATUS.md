### What works

* Automatically adding and removing peers and their routes when the system
  binds and unbinds IPs

* Automatically adding and removing the default route over the vula interface
  depending on if the system gateway coincides with a peer's IP.

* Keeping pinned peers and routes (including the gateway, when applicable)
  active after network state changes.

* Releasing the route via a pinned gateway peer via the `vula release-gateway`
  command, when the user is intentionally roaming away from a network where a
  pinned peer was the gateway.

* Editing peers and preferences using subcommands of `vula peer` and `vula
  prefs`.

### Known issues

Numerous in-progress known issues are documented in
[TODO.md](https://codeberg.org/vula/vula/src/branch/main/TODO.md), but
the most important issues to be aware of when using vula today are these:

* IPv6 support is only partially implemented. At this time, IPv6 traffic is not
  automatically protected. This includes internet-destined IPv6 traffic when
  the gateway is running `vula`. It is likely that there are currently ways
  that an attacker could use IPv6 to circumvent vula's protection of IPv4
  traffic against active attacks, so, for those protections to be strong you
  should currently disable IPv6 on the system completely. Vula's IPv6 support
  is improving, however, and we plan to provide strong protections against
  active attackers while using IPv6 in the near future.

* Coexistence with other usage of wireguard is currently a bit complicated.
  Activating another WireGuard interface using a typical `wg-quick`
  configuration after `vula` is running will cause `wg-quick` to insert its
  policy routing rules with a lower `pref` value (meaning, a higher priority)
  which will circumvent vula's rule and prevent traffic to vula peers
  from being protected. This can be worked around by editing the other
  connection's `wg-quick` config to set `Table = off` and to have `PostUp` and
  `PostDown` lines to perform all of the steps `wg-quick` normally performs,
  but with the addition of `pref` arguments in the `ip rule add` commands
  specifying `pref` values greater than vula's (666). Additionally, the
  `wg-quick`-managed interface should have its `Mtu` set it 1340, to allow for
  the overhead of running it over a vula gateway, and, at least in some
  configurations, a route to the other wireguard endpoint must be added (which can
  be done using the `vula peer addr add` command). With all of this carefully
  configured, if the route to the remote peer endpoint is added to a `pinned`
  gateway peer, this configuration can persist and the normal wireguard
  configuration can continue working while roaming on and off of a network with
  a vula gateway.  This will be handled much more smoothly in the future, and
  the documentation of the current situation should improve in the nearer
  future.

* The `vula verify` subcommands, including QR code scanning, have bitrotted and
  are currently non-functional. Peers can be marked as `pinned` and `verified`
  using the `vula peer set` command for now.

### Troubleshooting

The `vula repair` command will ensure that all peers have the correct routes
and wireguard peer configuration. It can be run with the `--dry-run` option to
print what would be corrected without actually modifying the system state. This
command should generally not find anything which needs to be repaired.

If you encounter problems while running vula and wish to stop the service, the
steps to do so are currently:

* `sudo systemctl stop vula.slice` to stop the software
* `sudo ip link del vula` to delete the device and the routes
* `sudo ip -4 rule delete 666 && sudo ip -6 rule delete 666` to remove the
  rules

To prevent the daemons from launching on startup, you can run `systemctl
disable --now vula-organize` and/or `apt remove python3-vula`.
