There are a wide variety of tools which can be used to create end-to-end
encrypted tunnels between hosts, or which share other superficial similarities
with Vula. To our knowledge, however, none of them achieve Vula's design goal
of providing fully-automatic end-to-end encryption of local area network
traffic.

The following is a list of unique properties which Vula provides:
* No infrastructure required
* Fully automatic: LAN traffic between hosts with Vula installed is protected without any configuration whatsoever
* Works on offline networks (eg, with RFC 3927 link-local addressing on ethernet, ad-hoc wifi, thunderbolt, etc)
* Protects traffic using existing IP addresses (whether DHCP-assigned, link-local, or manually configured), so applications do not need to be reconfigured
* Transitional post-quantum protection

Projects such as [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/),
[Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale), and
[innernet](https://github.com/tonarino/innernet) are similar to Vula in that
they can be used to encrypt traffic between hosts on a LAN using WireGuard
tunnels, but they differ in some important respects:

* They only create tunnels between hosts that are logged in to the same account on a centralized coordination server.
    * Tailscale outsources the operation of this component to Amazon, a surveillance actor
    * Headscale and innernet provide free software implementations which can be self-hosted, but remain a single point of failure
* They use a different IP range inside and outside of the tunnels, so LAN-based applications need to be reconfigured to benefit from it.
* They do not provide any post-quantum protection

With the exception of TCPcrypt and IPsec OE, the other projects listed here are
all designed to protect traffic between hosts which are configured to be part
of a single organization, whereas Vula provides automatic encryption of traffic
between *all* locally-reachable hosts that are running the software.

TCPcrypt is an outlier, in that it does provide opportunistic encryption
between hosts without any configuration; however, it only protects TCP traffic,
does not provide secure names, and its key verification system requires
application-specific support. These and other deployment impediments have
prevented its adoption.

IPsec OE also is designed to provide opportunistic encryption, but has [numerous](https://nohats.ca/wordpress/blog/2013/09/12/history-and-implementation-status-of-opportunistic-encryption-for-ipsec/) [shortcomings](https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg12325.html) and has failed to gain adoption.
