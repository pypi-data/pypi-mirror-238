During the 2021-2022 semester in a class led by one of the Vula authors,
students at the BFH contributed a number of commits for various projects at
various skill levels. Some of the projects were completed and others were only
completed as idea or as early stage prototypes. Contributions to complete,
audit, extend, or even potentially remove some of the changes are welcome.
Future sessions of this class will hopefully continue using Vula as a teaching
tool for students to learn about developing Free Software for Freedom.
