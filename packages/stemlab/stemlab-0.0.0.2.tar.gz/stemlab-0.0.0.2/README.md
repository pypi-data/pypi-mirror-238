## stemlab

Stemlab is a Python library for performing mathematical computations.
It aims to become a first choice library for trainers and students
in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the Stemlab library.

```bash
pip install stemlab
```

## Usage

The library is imported into a Python session by running the following import statement.

```python
import stemlab as stm
```

## Examples

We will give a few examples that will demonstrate the use of the Stemlab library. Before that, the following libraries need to be installed.

```python
import numpy as np
import sympy as sym
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Differentiation of parametric equations

```
x = 't^3 + 3 * t^2'
y = 't^4 - 8 * t^2'
result = stm.diff_parametric(f=x, g=y, dependent='t', n=3)
result
```

### Richardson extrapolation

```
f = '2**x * sin(x)'
x = 1.05
h = 0.4
n = 4
table, result = stm.diff_richardson(f, x, n, h, col_latex=False, index_labels='default', decimals=10)
table
```

### Gauss-Legendre quadrature integration

```
f = '(x^2 + 2 * x + 1) / (1 + (x + 1)^4)'
a, b, n = (0, 2, 4)
table, result = stm.int_glegendre(f, a, b, n, decimals=12)
table
```

### Initial value problems

```
f = 'y - t^2 + 1'
dydx = ['y - t^2 - 2*t + 1', 'y - t^2 - 2*t - 1', 'y - t^2 - 2*t - 1', 'y - t^2 - 2*t - 1']
ft = '(t + 1)^2 - 0.5*exp(t)'
a, b = (0, 2)
y0 = 0.5
h = 0.2

## Taylor order 4

table, figure = stm.int_odes(
	method = 'taylor4',
	ode_equation=f,
	exact_solution=ft,
	time_span=[a, b],
	initial_y=y0,
	ode_derivs=dydx,
	decimals=12
)
table

## Fourth order Runge-Kutta

table, figure = stm.int_odes(
	method = 'rk4',
	ode_equation=f,
	exact_solution=ft,
	time_span=[a, b],
	initial_y=y0,
	hmin=.01,
	hmax=.25,
	tolerance=1e-5,
	decimals=12
)
table
```

## Support
