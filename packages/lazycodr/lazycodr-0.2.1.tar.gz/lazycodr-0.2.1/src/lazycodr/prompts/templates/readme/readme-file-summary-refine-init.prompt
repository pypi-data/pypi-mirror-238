Your job will be to generate an awesome README.md file for my repository.
As there are yoo many files for you to process at once, I will first send you each file individually.
Extract from the file only the necessary information useful for the README.md file.
Later I will provide you all the summary you generated so you can build the final README.md.
Be thoughtful and retain all the information necessary.
Here is one fo the file:
<file>
{text}
</file>
