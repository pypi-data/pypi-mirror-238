Your job is to generate an awesome README.md file for my repository.
As there are yoo many files for you to process at once, I sent you each file individually.
You extracted from the files only the necessary information useful to create the README.md file.
Now I provide you all the summaries you generated so you can build the final README.md.
Here it is:
<file>
{context}
</file>

Write the README.md (make it well-formatted and appealing with some emojis).
