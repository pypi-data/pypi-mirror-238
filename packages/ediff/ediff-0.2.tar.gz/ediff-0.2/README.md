EDIFF :: processing of powder electron diffraction patterns
-----------------------------------------------------------
* EDIFF is under development, but key modules do work:
    - io = input/output data treatment
	- bkgr = background subtraction
	- center = find center of 2D powder diffraction pattern
	- radial = calculate radial distribution (2D-pattern to 1D-pattern) 
	- pxrd = calculation of theoretical powder X-ray diffraction patterns

Installation
------------
* `pip install bground` = interactive background subtraction
* `pip install ediff`   = EDIFF program itself (uses bground internally)

Quick start
-----------
* See how it works:
	- Look at [worked example](https://mirekslouf.github.io/ediff/docs/examples/ex1_ediff.nb.html)
      in Jupyter.
* Try it yourself:
	- Download and unzip the [complete example with data](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/nmsvdtef7xtmb7r2ku5aa/h?dl=0&rlkey=2evadkk009wp248rp2c3ij2nj).
	- Look at `00readme.txt` and run the example in Jupyter.
