Your task is to inspect the table of contents that is provided below and to produce a new table of contents which is formatted EXACTLY as the example above. 

{table_of_contents}

Further, if the table of contents is less than 20 chapters, or lacking sufficient detail in any given chapter, then your task is to coherently expand the table and re-arrange it so that it is 20+ chapters, with 3-4 sections and 3-4 subsections per chapter, formatted exactly as the example above.

If the table of contents is already in the correct format and complete, reproduce it as-is with the new formatting.


Notes:
- Chapters should be numbered `Chapter 1`, `Chapter 2`, etc.
- Sections should be numbered `Section 1.1`, `Section 1.2`, etc.
- Subsections should be numbered `1.1a`, `1.1b`, etc.
- The table of contents should contain no indentations.
- The table of contents should be 20 chapters or more, and have 3-4 sections and 3-4 subsections per chapter.
