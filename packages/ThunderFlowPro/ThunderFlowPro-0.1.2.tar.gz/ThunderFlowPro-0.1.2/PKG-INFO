# ThunderFlowPro

ThunderFlowPro
EV-battery-estimation-calculator
This code estimates electric vehicle (EV) battery consumption and speed based solely on GPS coordinates and timestamps. It processes the data to calculate distances and time intervals between points, allowing for the computation of average speeds. An energy consumption model is applied, considering speed and battery characteristics, to estimate energy usage. 

## Installation

You can install this package using pip:

```bash
pip install ThunderFlowPro
```

## Usage
```python
import ThunderFlowPro as T

# Example usage

lst_traj=T.consumption(df,
                CreateTrajectories=True,                               
                temporal_thr=1200,
                spatial_thr=50,
                minpoints=4,
                MapMatching='valhalla',
                ResultsByTrajectory=True
                )
```

## Features

Main Feature: EV Battery Consumption Estimation
This package offers a comprehensive set of tools and functionalities for estimating the battery consumption of Electric Vehicles (EVs). This feature is invaluable for various stakeholders in the electric vehicle industry, including EV manufacturers, fleet managers, and EV users. It enables them to make informed decisions and optimize EV usage and charging strategies.
