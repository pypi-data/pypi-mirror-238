    :param psf: a string that contains the path to the psf file that is the basis for the .dcd files.
    :param name: A name for the trajectory passed to getList. This determines the file name to which the
    resulting numpy arrays will be saved. This is mandatory to ensure the creation of a backup file-
    :param Stride: (default 1) An integer that indicates the step to go through the dcd. Example: A stride of 2 would
    mean, that only every second frame is read in.
    :param number: an integer that allows to set an upper bound for the number of frames
    :param skip: an integer that allows to set the number of frames to be skipped at the beginning
    :param exclude: list of strings that allows the exclusion of residues, synthax of the strings has to be
    e.g. SER29 to exclude Serine at position 29.
    :param find_exclude if one does not know, if there are doubles that need to be removed, find_exclude True will
    attempt a fix, results are to be handled with care
    :param remove_atoms is a list of atom names not specifically connected to a residue which should be removed. Default
    removes standard IONS.
    :return: returns a numpy array containing all the geometric information of each atom in the simulation except
    for water and ions and a numpy array containing the names of all these atoms. Finally, it returns an md.traj object
    containing the information of the very first frame. This allows selection methods, if needed.

    Description: This is the supporting function, that converts a psf and dcds into the needed numpy array.
    dcds is a list of strings containing the file names of the dcds in either relative or absolute paths.
    psf is the psf file associated with the dcds
    Stride defines the step size. This can greatly decrease memory usage.
    number is the maximum number of frames considered and skip allows to skip the first frames completely. This
    is handy, in case one was waiting for a structure to equilibrate.
    In total (number-skip)/Stride frames will be considered.

    FAQ: 
    1. Can I have two different psfs for two different structures with two different dcds?
        Of course, but that would be two structures and so you would run getList() twice, once for each structure
    2. What is a negative selection?
        A negative selection means, you choose the things you want to exclude and you specifically do not choose
        the things you want to keep.
    3. What if there are other salts?
        This iteration deals with the standard salt. If additional salts are needed, one can jump to
        remove_unnecessary() and add the salt names to list of atomnames.
