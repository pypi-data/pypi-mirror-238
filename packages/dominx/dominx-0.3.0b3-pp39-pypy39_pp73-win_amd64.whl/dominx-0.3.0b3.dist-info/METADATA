The **dominx** library is a powerful high-level Python library designed specifically for game
development, leveraging the low-level APIs of operating systems like Win32, X11, Cocoa, and more.
It offers a seamless interface for game developers to harness the full potential of these
low-level APIs without getting bogged down in complex code.

## Installation

You can install the library using `pip`. Before installation, ensure you have Python and pip
installed on your system. The library requires Python 3.7 or later to function properly.

```bash
pip install dominx
```

Alternatively, you can install the latest version directly from the GitHub repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/zenthm/dominx.git
```
