Short activist predictor
===================
## Note

This Python package provides a machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of success for short activist reports targeting public companies.

### Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install short_activist_predictor
```
### Usage

The package provides a `Predictor` module with function `predict_pdf()` that takes in a path to the PDF file of the short report and the target company name. It loads and analyzes the report text using NLP. The Predictor then outputs probability scores between 0-1 predicting the chance of a successful outcome from the report release over 3 time periods - within 1 days, 1 week, and 1 month.

Here's an example of how to use the `Predictor.predict_pdf()` function:

``` python    
from short_activist_predictor.predictor import Predictor

# Create a predictor instance by hf token indentification
predictor_ = Predictor(Predictor.Login_Token())

# Upload the report in pdf format
# This following function will ask you to upload a pdf to
while(True):
  predictor_.predict_pdf()
```
