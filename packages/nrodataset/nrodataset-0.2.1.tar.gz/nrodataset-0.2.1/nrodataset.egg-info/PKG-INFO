# NRODataset

This is a dataset of complex networks, which contains multiple network data samples, each of which includes the original
network and the network after robustness optimization.

# Details

This dataset includes networks with different synthetic models, such as Small World, Scale-Free...,
it also includes different sizes and average degree of networks.
