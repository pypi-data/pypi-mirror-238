This package is a lightweight, pure-Python implementation of the AVL tree. AVL trees are simple self-balancing binary
search trees, giving them both amortized and worst-case time complexities of O[log(n)] for insertion, deletion, and
retrieval. More reference can be found on the [AVL tree Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree).
