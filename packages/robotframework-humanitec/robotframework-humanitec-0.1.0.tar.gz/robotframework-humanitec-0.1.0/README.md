# robotframework-humanitec

Demo library for Humanitec API. [Keyword Documentation](https://robotframework-humanitec-noordsestern-f672fb1c9b527e491cb115577.gitlab.io/)

See [`demo.robot`](tests/demo.robot).

You will need:

- environment variable `HUMANITEC_TOKEN` with value of a valid API token from your Humanitec organisation
- environment variable `HUMANITEC_ORG_ID` with value of id from your Humanitec organisation

# State: Alpha

This is a demo right now. I am undecided whether to use auto generated swagger client or rely entirely on handmade REST calls based on requests module.
