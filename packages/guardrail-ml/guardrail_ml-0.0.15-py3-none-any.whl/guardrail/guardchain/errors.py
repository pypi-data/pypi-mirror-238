class OutputParserException(Exception):
    """Exception raised by output parsers to signify a parsing error.

    This exception is specifically used for handling parsing errors encountered while processing
    the output from a tool. It allows differentiation between parsing errors and other code or
    execution errors that may occur within the output parser. When an OutputParserException is
    raised, it can be caught and handled in a way to address the parsing error, while other errors
    will be raised as usual.
