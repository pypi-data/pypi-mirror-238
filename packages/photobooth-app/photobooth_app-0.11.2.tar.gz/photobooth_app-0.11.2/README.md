## üòç Features

- üìπ camera live preview with shortest delay as possible, permanent video live view in background
- ‚ö°Ô∏è optimized for speed, live stream hardware accelerated on rpi, cpu load < 20%
- ü´∂ several camera backends supported for high quality stills and livestream
- üí° WLED support signaling photo countdown and feedback to the user when the photo is actually taken
- ü§ù Linux üêß, Raspberry Pi üçì and Windows ü™ü platforms supported

## üì∑ Supported Cameras

The photobooth app's Python backend allows to use different camera types on Linux and Windows platforms:

- Raspberry Pi Camera Module 1/2/3 (with or without autofocus)
- Arducam cameras (with or without autofocus)
- DSLR camera via
  - gphoto2, Linux
  - digicamcontrol, Windows (not yet implemented)
- webcams (via opencv2 or v4l)

The app controls camera's autofocus, handles led signaling when a photo is taken and streams live video to photobooth.

The reference photobooth box is made from 3d printed parts, [see the 3d printed reference box over here](https://mgrl.github.io/photobooth-docs/photobox3dprint/).

## üõ´ Speed Optimized

The photobooth app uses libraries optimized for speed. Even a Raspberry Pi 3B+ is fine to use.
Typically the photobooth app takes following times to process data:

| Task | RPI 3B+ | RPI 4B | Intel i7 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| CPU load with picamera2 livestream and display | ~20% | ~20% | <1% |
| Postprocess: scale images for preview | <500ms | <350ms | <30ms |
| Postprocess: Stage "Remove Greenscreen" | 130ms | 90ms | 20ms |
| Postprocess: Stage "Add Text" | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| Postprocess: Stage "Apply Instagram-Like Filter" | n/a | <80ms | <30ms |

## üíÖ Screenshots

[Find screenshots in the documentation](https://mgrl.github.io/photobooth-docs/screenshots)

## üîß Installation

[See separate installation instructions in the documentation](https://mgrl.github.io/photobooth-docs/setup/installation/).

The photobooth app can be used standalone but is not feature complete yet.
Anyway, it integrates well with the fully blown [photobooth project](https://photoboothproject.github.io/),
see [description how to achieve integration](https://mgrl.github.io/photobooth-docs/reference/photoboothprojectintegration/).
