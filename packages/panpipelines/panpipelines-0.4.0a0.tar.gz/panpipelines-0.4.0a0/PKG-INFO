# PANpipelines
---
This repository contains all the necessary scripts for reproducing the steps taken to preprocess and analyze MRI data collected during the Precision Aging Network (PAN) project.

## `panpipelines` package
The PAN Pipelines use a set of python modules packaged under the main `panpipelines` package to run all the preprocessing and analysis workflows which are based on NiPype.
