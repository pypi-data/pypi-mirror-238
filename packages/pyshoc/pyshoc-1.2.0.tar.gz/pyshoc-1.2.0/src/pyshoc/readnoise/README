This module provides access to instrument specs for SHOC. The files named
'data/SHOC1.txt' and 'data/SHOC2.txt' provide the manufacturer measurements of
the readout noise, base level (bias) and sensitivity for each available camera
setting of readout speed, ADC bit-depth, pre-amplifier gain, and output
amplifier mode (Electron Multiplying or Conventional).

The serial numbers for both SHOC CCDs are:
 SHOC1      SHOC2
 5982       6448

The table columns are as follows

FreqMHz:
    Clock frequency for readout
BitDepth:
    ADC bit-depth
Mode:
    Which output amplifier is being used: EM or CON
PreAmp:
    gain (ADU / e)
Sensitivity:
    ADC sensitivity (e / ADU)
ReadNoise:
    Readout noise (e)
ReadTime:
    Readout time (Î¼s)
Saturation:
    Full well / ADC saturation (whichever comes first)
BaseLevel:
    Lab measured bias level
