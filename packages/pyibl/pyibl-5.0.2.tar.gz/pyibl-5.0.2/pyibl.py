        When a default utility is needed that function will be called, passing the choice
        in question to it, and the value returned, which should be a Real, will be used.
        If at that time the value is not a function of one argument, or it does not return
        a Real, a :exc:`RuntimeError` is raised.

        Setting :attr:`default_utility` to ``None`` or ``False`` (the initial default)

        created or last :meth:`reset`; providing *time* will cause the instances to be
        added at that specified time instead of the current time.

        This is typically used to enable startup of a model by adding instances before the
        first call to :meth:`choose`. When used in this way the timestamp associated with
        this occurrence of the instance will be zero. Subsequent occurrences are possible

        occurrences will have later timestamps. An alternative mechanism to facilitate
        sartup of a model is setting the :attr:`default_utility` property of the agent.
        While rarely done, a modeler can even combine the two mechanisms, if desired.

        It is also possible to call :meth:`populate` after choose/respond cycles have
        occurred. In this case the instances are added with the current time as the
        timestamp. This is one less than the timestamp that would be used were an instance
        to be added by being experienced as part of a choose/respond cycle instead. Each
        agent keeps internally a clock, the number of choose/respond cycles that have
        occurred since it was created or last :meth:`reset`. When :meth:`choose` is called
        it advances that clock by one *before* computing the activations of the existing
        instances, as it must since the activation computation depends upon all
        experiences having been in the past. That advanced clock is the timestamp used
        when an instance is added or reinforced by :meth:`respond`.

            In normal use you should only call :meth:`populate` before any choose/respond
            cycles. If, for exotic purposes, you do wish to call it after, caution should
            be exercised to avoid biologically implausible models. It should not normally
            be necessary to use the *when* argument, which is provided only for esoteric
            uses. In particular adding instances in the future will usually result in

        The expected form of the *choices* depends upon whether or not this :class:`Agent`
        has any attributes or not. If it does not, each of the *choices* should be a
        :class:`Hashable` that is not ``None``, representing an atomic choice; if any of
        the *choices* are not hashable or are ``None`` a :exc:`ValueError` is raised.

        If this :class:`Agent` does have attributes (that is, the *attributes* argument
        was supplied and non-empty when it was created, or, equivalently, the value of the
        :attr:`attributes` property is a non-empty list), then each of the *choices* can
        be either a :class:`Mapping`, typically a :class:`dict`, mapping attribute names
        to their values, or a :class:`Sequence`, typically a :class:`list`, containing
        attribute values in the order they were declared when this :class:`Agent` was
        created and would be returned by :attr:`attributes`. Attributes not present
        (either there is no key in the :class:`Mapping`, or a :class:`Sequence` shorter
        than the number of attributes) have a value of `None`, while values not
        corresponding to attributes of the :class:`Agent` (either a key in the
        :class:`Mapping` that does not match an attribute name, or a :class:`Sequence`
        longer than the number of attributes) are ignored. Whether a :class:`Mapping` or a
        :class:`Sequence`, all the attribute values must be :class:`Hashable`, and are
        typically strings or numbers. If any of the *choices* do not have one of these
        forms a :exc:`ValueError` is raised.

        In either case, if any pair of the *choices* duplicate each other, even if of
        different forms (e.g. dictionary versus list), and after adding default ``None``
        values and removing ignored values, a :exc:`ValueError` is raised.

        It is also possible to supply no *choices*, in which case those used in the most
        recent previous call to this method are reused. If there was no such previous call
        since the last time this :class:`Agent` was :meth:`reset` a :exc:`ValueError` is
        raised.

        For each of the *choices* this method finds all instances in memory that match,
        and computes their activations at the current time based upon when in the past
        they have been seen, modified by the value of the :attr:`decay` property, and with
        noise added as controlled by the :attr:`noise` property. If partial matching has
        been enabled with :attr:`mismatch_penalty` such matching instances need not match
        exactly, and the similarities modified by the mismatch penalty are subtracted from
        the activations. If partial matching is not enabled only those instances that
        match exactly are consulted. "Exact" matches are based on Python's ``==``
        operator, not ``is``. Thus, for example ``0``, ``0.0`` and ``False`` all match one
        another, as do ``1``, ``1.0`` and ``True``.

        Looking at the activations of the whole ensemble of instances matching a choice a
        retrieval probability is computed for each possible outcome, and these are
        combined to arrive at a blended value expected for the choice. This blending
        operation depends upon the value of the :attr:`temperature` property; if none is
        supplied a default is computed based on the value of the :attr:`noise` parameter.
        The value chosen and returned is that element of *choices* with the highest
        blended value. In case of a tie one will be chosen at random.

        After a call to :attr:`choose` a corresponding call must be made to
        :meth:`respond` before calling :meth:`choose` again, or a :exc:`RuntimeError` will
        be raised.

        If the *details* argument is also supplied and is ``True`` two values are returned
        as a 2-tuple, the first as above and the second containing data used to arrive at
        the selection. While the comparison of blended values used by :meth:`choose` is
        the appropriate process for most models, for some specialized purposes the modeler
        may wish to implement a different decision procedure. This additional information,
        when combined with supplying a second argment to :meth:`respond`, facilitates the
        construction of such more complicated models.

        The second return value is a list of dicts, one for each choice. These dicts have
        entries for the choice, the blended value, and a list of retrieval probability
        descriptions. The retrieval probability descriptions are themselves dicts, one for
        each instance consulted in constructing the given choice's blended value. Each of
        these latter dicts has two entries, one for the utility stored in the instance and
        the other its probability of retrieval.

        Because of noise the results returned by :attr:`choose` are stochastic, so the
        results of running the following examples may differ in their details from those
        shown.

        This results in the creation or reinforcemnt of an instance in memory for the
        decision with the given outcome, and is the fundamental way in which the PyIBL
        model "learns from experience."

        By default the choice selected by :meth:`choose` is the one to which the outcome
        is attached. In unusual cases, however, the modeler may prefer to select a
        different choice; for example, if using a different decision procedure based on
        the information returned by a ``True`` value of the second argument to
        :meth:`Choose`, or if performing model tracing of an individual human's behavior
        on the experiment being modeled. To support these unusual cases a second argument
        may be passed to :meth:`respond`, which is the choice to actually be made. If it
        is not one of the choices provided in the original call to :meth:`choose` a
        ``ValueError`` is raised.

        It is also possible to delay feedback, by calling :meth:`respond` without
        arguments, or with the first argument being ``None``. This tells the
        :class:`Agent` to assume it has received feedback equal to that it expected, that
        is, the blended value resulting from past experiences. In this case
        :meth:`respond` returns a value, a :class:`DelayedRespone` object, which can be
        used subsequently to update the response.

        .. warning::
            Delayed feedback is an experimental feature and care should be exercised in
            its use to avoid biologically implausible models.

        If there has not been a call to :meth:`choose` since the last time :meth:`respond`
        was called a :exc:`RuntimeError` is raised. If *outcome* is neither ``None`` nor a

        the attribute namess contain spaces or commas a string consisting of the names,
        separated by commas or spaces (but not both) may be used instead of a list. For an
        :class:`Agent` that has no attributes the *attributes* argument should be empty or
        omitted.

        The *function* argument should be a ``Callable``, taking two arguments, or
        ``True``. The similarity value returned should be a real number between zero and
        one, inclusive. If ``True`` is passed as the value of *function* a default
        similarity function is used which returns one if its two arguments are ``==`` and
        zero otherwise. If, when called, the function returns a number outside that range
        a :exc:`RuntimeError` is raised. If, when the similarity function is called, the
        return value is not a real number a :exc:`ValueError` is raised.

        The *weight* should be a positive, real number, and defaults to one.

        Similarity functions are only called when the `Agent` has a
        :attr:`mismatch_penalty` specified. When a similarity function is called it is
        passed two arguments, attribute values to compare. The function should be
        commutative; that is, if called with the same arguments in the reverse order, it
        should return the same value. It should also be stateless, always returning the
        same values if passed the same arguments. If either of these constraints is
        violated no error is raised, but the results will, in most cases, be meaningless.

        If one of *function* or *weight* is omitted but the other is supplied, the
        supplied item is set with the omitted one unchanged. If called with neither
        *function* nor *weight* the similarity function is removed.

        In the following examples the height and width are assumed to range from zero to

When the returned function is called if either of its arguments is not a Real number a
