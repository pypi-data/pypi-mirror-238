## Typing stubs for s2clientprotocol

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`s2clientprotocol`](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`s2clientprotocol`.

This version of `types-s2clientprotocol` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `s2clientprotocol==5.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/s2clientprotocol. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `9d345b4df42939b697a84ee461a8760eb674050e` and was tested
with mypy 1.6.1, pyright 1.1.332, and
pytype 2023.10.17.
