# Grid3.py

This is a collection of Python modules for working with ThreeFold Grid v3. It's designed foremostly for interactive use on the REPL and joyful scripting. We value conciseness and trying to do what you *meant* even at the expense of a few extra CPU cycles.

If you're looking for a Grid v3 SDK for writing efficient and maintainable code bases, check out Go or Rust. For code that must execute in the user's browser, see Typescript.

## Installation

Get yourself a virtual environment (or live dangerously and shoot for system-wide, up to you) and then install the library using `pip`:

```
python -m venv venv
pip install ...
```

## Quick tour

With grid3.py, you can easily answer questions like, how many nodes are currently in the standby state that were online in the last 36 hours?

```
import time, grid3.util
mainnet = grid3.util.GridNetwork()
sleepers = mainnet.graphql.nodes(['nodeID'], power={'state': 'Down'}, updatedAt_gt=int(time.time()) - 24 * 60 * 60)
len(sleepers)
```

We just executed a query against the mainnet GraphQL endpoint `nodes` without even sweating a line break. Pretty cool!

Then we can query a wallet balance on TF Chain:

And create deployments (coming soon).
