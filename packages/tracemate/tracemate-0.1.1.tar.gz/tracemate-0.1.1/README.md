## :package: Installation

To install Tracemate, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install tracemate
```

## :hammer_and_wrench: Usage

Here's how to get started:

Use this in your main.py (or equivalent) file to autonomously add logging and obtain logger and console objects from a centralized location. You can use setup_logging from multiple modules and it works fine.

```python
from tracemate import setup_logging, apply_logger_to_all_functions

backend_logger, ui_logger, console = setup_logging()
apply_logger_to_all_functions(backend_logger)
```

For a more comprehensive guide, please refer to the [Documentation](#-documentation).
