_Automated logging setup for Python applications_

Tracemate is a Python library designed to make logging hassle-free. Just import it into your `main.py`, and Tracemate takes care of setting up logging for all your functions. It's lightweight, easy to integrate, and designed to have minimal impact on application performance.

## :rocket: Features

- **Automated Logging**: Just import Tracemate in your `main.py` and it will automatically set up logging for all your functions.
- **High Performance**: Designed for minimal performance overhead.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Full support for asynchronous Python applications.
- **Simple Integration**: Easy to integrate into existing projects without modifying your codebase.

## :package: Installation

To install Tracemate, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install tracemate
```

---

## :hammer_and_wrench: Usage

Here's how to get started:

Use this in your main.py (or equivalent) file to autonomously add logging and obtain logger and console objects from a centralized location. You can use setup_logging from multiple modules and it works fine.

```python
from tracemate import setup_logging, apply_logger_to_all_functions

backend_logger, ui_logger, console = setup_logging()
apply_logger_to_all_functions(backend_logger)
```

For a more comprehensive guide, please refer to the [Documentation](#-documentation).
