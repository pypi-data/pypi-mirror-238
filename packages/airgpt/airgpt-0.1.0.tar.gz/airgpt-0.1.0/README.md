# airgpt

This repository contains `airgpt`: a command line tool empowered by AI and LLM.

## Run Python scripts
The following steps could be run locally to test out `airgpt`:

1. Set up an virtual environment and install the required libraries listed in requirements.txt

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -i requirements.txt
```

2. Run `airgpt.py`: it calls OpenAI to get the command based on user prompts
