<!-- start short-description -->
Python has implemented `map`, `filter` etc. as functions, rather than methods on a sequence. This makes the result harder to read and Iterators less used than they could be. FunctionalPy exists to change that.

<!-- end short-description -->

## Install
```bash
pip install functionalpy
```

## Usage
```python
from functionalpy import Seq

result = (Seq([1, 2])
            .filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
            .map(lambda x: x * 2)
            .to_list()
)
assert result == [4]
```

## Dev environment setup
