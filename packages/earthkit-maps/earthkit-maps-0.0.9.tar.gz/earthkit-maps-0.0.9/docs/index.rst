    This project is in the **BETA** stage of development. Please be aware that interfaces and functionality may change as the project develops. If this software is to be used in operational systems you are **strongly advised to use a released tag in your system configuration**, and you should be willing to accept incoming changes and bug fixes that require adaptations on your part. ECMWF **does use** this software in operations and abides by the same caveats.

and climate maps using a simple API and a convenient library of templates.
