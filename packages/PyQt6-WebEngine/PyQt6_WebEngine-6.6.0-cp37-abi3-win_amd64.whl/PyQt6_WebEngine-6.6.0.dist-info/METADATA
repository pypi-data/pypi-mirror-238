PyQt6-WebEngine - Python Bindings for the Qt WebEngine Framework
================================================================

PyQt6-WebEngine is a set of Python bindings for The Qt Company's Qt WebEngine
framework.  The framework provides the ability to embed web content in
applications and is based on the Chrome browser.  The bindings sit on top of
PyQt6 and are implemented as three separate modules corresponding to the
different libraries that make up the framework.
