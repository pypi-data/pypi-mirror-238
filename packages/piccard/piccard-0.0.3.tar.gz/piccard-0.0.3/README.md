# Piccard

## Introduction
**piccard** is a Python package which provides an alternative framework to traditional harmonization techniques for combining spatial data with inconsistent geographic units across multiple years. It uses a network representation containing nodes and edges to retain all information available in the data. Nodes are used to represent all the geographic areas (e.g., census tracts, dissemination areas) for each year. An edge connects two nodes when the geographic area corresponding to the tail node has at least a 5% area overlap with the geographic area corresponding to the head node in the previous available year.

### Research
The method behind this package can be found in the following research paper:

## Installation
The latest released version is available at the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/piccard)

```
pip install piccard
```

## Importing the package

```
from piccard import piccard as pc 
```

## Useful Functions

**piccard.preprocessing(ct_data, year, id)**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return a cleaned GeoDataFrame of the input data with a new column showing the area of each census tract.  

**piccard.create_network(census_dfs, years, id, threshold=0.05)**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creates a network representation of the temporal connections present in *census_dfs* over *years* when each yearly geographic area has at most *threshold* percentage of overlap with its corresponding area(s) in the next year.  

**piccard.create_network_table(census_dfs, years, id, threshold=0.05)**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return the final network table with all the temporal connections present in *census_dfs* over *years* when each yearly geographic area has at most *threshold* percentage of overlap with its corresponding area(s) in the next year.  

**piccard.draw_subnetwork(network_table, G, num_cts=4)**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Draws a subgraph of the network representation where *num_cts* is the number of census tracts in the first census year which are followed through all census years.  

**piccard.plot_num_cts(network_table, years, id)**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plots the number of census tracts across all given census years.

**Note**: Further explanation of the parameters and example code for all the above functions can be found in the [documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lodi-m/piccard/blob/main/docs/documentation.html).
