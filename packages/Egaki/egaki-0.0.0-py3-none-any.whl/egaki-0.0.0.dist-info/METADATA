# Egaki
Welcome to the home page of Egaki, a programming language with a syntax written completely in emoji. 

## Overview
Egaki is currently under development. When completed, the language will be interpreted to Python at runtime. The language remains in early-stage development. Check out the roadmap below to see what features are available.

## Motivation
The impetus for this project is a desire to strengthen my understanding of Python, particularly its class nomenclature and built-in methods. 
While practicing code on my phone while commuting, I found it annoying to continuously be forced to switch between the standard keyboard, symbols selector, advanced symbols pane, and formatting tools, and wondered if emoji, if formatted correctly in a purpose-built mobile terminal emulator, could provide a mobile-first development experience. While this project will not be building said mobile terminal application, it will attempt to simulate the experience. 

## Follow Along!
While building this project, I'll be writing more in-depth about the experience, the project's design choices, and what this language might actually look like on mobile. A link to this writing will be provided here after the first post is published.

## Roadmap
_Note: This roadmap will evolve as the project grows_
