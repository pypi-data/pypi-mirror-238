# MyCityCO2 Chart Of Account Dataset

The chart of account dataset is there when exporting all data to an CSV. We match the account code with [fnmath](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) pattern matching. The file are consider like an SQL base with relation in between. We separate them so we don't have redondante variable, and easy to edit for future run of our French Importer. Those data are generated by hand, by our Project Manager.

# MyCityCO2 Mapping Dataset

The monetary emission factors will be pulled from this [Exiobase](https://zenodo.org/record/5589597#.Yh9_Zi8w1ao).
It provides provides a time series of monetary emission factors tables ranging from 1995 to a recent year for 44 countries (28 EU member plus 16 major economies) and five rest of the world regions. Our mapping dataset has been only extracted for France data.

The main benefits with this datasource is to have emission factors computed consistently across region and over time. Yearly emission factors are needed by MyCityCO2 in order to deal with inflation.

The files are coming from the yearly files IOT_{year}_pxp.zip . Within this zip, the file to use sits under \impacts\M.txt and the line to read in order to retrieve GHG emissions is named : "GHG emissions AR5 (GWP100) | GWP100 (IPCC, 2010)"

Our dataset is used to match our account code with [fnmath](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) pattern matching to match to carbon emision factor. Both in the 'Investisement' and 'Fonctionning' budget.

# MyCityCO2 City Dataset

These dataset has been extracted from [insee](https://www.insee.fr/fr/accueil) and is used to match siren and insee code and insee code with postal code. That is then used in our website to display data. So the dataset is only used for the export of the data

# MyCityCO2 Carbon Dataset

The carbon Dataset is used to create the emision carbon factor in you're [Odoo](odoo.com).
