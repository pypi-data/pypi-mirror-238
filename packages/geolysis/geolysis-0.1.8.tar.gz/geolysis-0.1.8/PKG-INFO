## What is geolysis?

`geolysis` is an open-source software for geotechnical engineering analysis and
modeling. `geolysis` provides soil classification based on `USCS` and `AASHTO`
standards, `bearing capacity analysis`,`estimation of soil engineering
properties`, `settlement analysis`, and `finite element modeling`. The software
assists geotechnical engineers in their day-to-day work, enabling them to
efficiently perform a wide range of tasks and make informed decisions about
design and construction. `geolysis` enhances efficiency and effectiveness,
allowing engineers to design and build better projects.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> Project is still under development.

```shell
pip install geolysis
```

## Usage example

Classification of soil using `AASHTO` classification system.

```python

    >>> from geolysis.soil_classifier import AASHTO
    >>> aashto_classifier = AASHTO(liquid_limit=37.7,
    ...                            plasticity_index=13.9,
    ...                            fines=47.44)
    >>> aashto_classifier.classify()
    'A-6(4)'

```
