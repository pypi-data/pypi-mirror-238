RegexAI is designed to be used in conjunction with regex. It makes regex conversational, allowing you to ask questions to your data in natural language.

### Queries

For example, you can ask RegexAI to Find words that contain the letter 'q' but not followed by 'u,' and replace them with the word 'quarantined.' from the user given paragraph :

```python
from regexai.pattern import apikey

# Sample paragraph and regex query
test_paragraph = """In a racecar, the radar detected an abnormal level of radioactive materials. Please contact support at support@example.com or visit our website at https://www.example.com. You can also reach us at +1 (123) 456-7890. For inquiries, please send an email to info@example.org. Remember, regex is a powerful tool that can validate 1234 different types of input data! Not all q
words are quirky, but regex can help you find them. Please enter your 16-digit credit card number: 4532015115898164.""" 
query = """ Find words that contain the letter 'q' but not followed by 'u,' and replace them with the word 'quarantined.' """

# Instantiate an object
od=apikey("your openai key")
print("Output : ", od.find_all(test_paragraph,query))
print("Generated Code for your Query : ")
print(od.get_pattern())
```

The above code will return the following:

```
Output :  In a racecar, the radar detected an abnormal level of radioactive materials.
Please contact support at support@example.com or visit our website at https://www.example.com. You can also reach us at +1 (123) 456-7890. For inquiries, please send an email to info@example.org. Remember, regex is a powerful tool that can validate 1234 different types of input data! Not all quarantined words are quirky, but regex can help you find them.
Please enter your 16-digit credit card number: 4532015115898164.

Generated Code for your Query : 
import re
result = re.sub(r'\bq(?!u)\w+\b', 'quarantined', da)
```

Of course, you can also ask RegexAI to perform more complex queries depending upon your need and requirements.
