================
Unglue It Driver
================

Driver to retrieve metrics from the Unglue.it portal.

Refer to https://unglue.it/api/help to get the api key from.

Code for the HIRMEOS project is available at https://github.com/hirmeos/unglueit_driver.

Troubleshooting
===============

At the moment of testing the plugin, despite doing 3 get requests to the API to get
the needed dataset it wasn't slow enough to be a concern but an improvement to the
API would be great making less calls and a filter by date would be a preference.

Another improvement straight away related to the package would be adding the rest of
identifiers from the dataset returned ('goog' and 'oclc') if they are needed in the future.
