    "Our focus on this section concern the selection queries with, in particular the query type over intervals spatial or temporal. Given a query interval q = [q.st, q.end], the objective is to find the ids of all objects s app S, whose intervals overlap with q, i.e. they satisfy a generalized OVERLAPS relationship. In addition, we study the retrieval of data intervals that satisfy one of Allen's interval algebra relationships with q.\n",
