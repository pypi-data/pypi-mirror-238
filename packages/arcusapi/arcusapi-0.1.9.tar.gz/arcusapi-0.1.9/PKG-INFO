# Arcus Data Exchange Client SDK

The Arcus Data Exchange is a two-sided auction house that matches Data Consumers
with Data Publishers. Data Consumers leverage data from the auction to improve 
their AI applications’ performance, while Data Publishers monetize and distribute 
their data through the auction system. The Arcus Client SDK allows you to consume 
data from the Arcus Data Exchange  without any changes to your core ML workflows. 
Your models and data stay where they are, while the client libraries integrate 
popular ML frameworks andlibraries with the Data Exchange to transparently
pull in high value data and signals and simply improve your AI performance.

## Installation

Install with PyPI (`pip`):

```
pip install arcusapi
```

You can verify your installation by running `import arcus` in Python:

```
$ python
Python 3.9.16 (main, Feb 28 2023, 06:13:28) 
[Clang 12.0.5 (clang-1205.0.22.9)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import arcus
```

Once your package is installed, you can get started using Arcus to
automatically enrich your ML models and prompts.

Refer to the Arcus [documentation](https://app.arcus.co/docs/) for more
information.
