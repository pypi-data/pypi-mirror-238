# Walker Layout

This package provides a way to generate level-based tree layouts (i.e. (x, y) coordinates for each node in a tree graph, such that nodes with the same depth from the root node are placed on the same y-height) using Walker's algorithm (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/spe.4380200705) including improvements by Buchheim et al. (2002) to make it linear in time (https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-36151-0_32.pdf). One can then use these layouts to draw the graph in the xy-plane.

You can either directly supply a networkx graph:

```python
from walkerlayout import WalkerLayouting
import networkx as nx

G = nx.Graph()
G.add_nodes_from(range(0,8))
G.add_edges_from([(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,4), (3,5), (3,6), (5,7)])

layout = WalkerLayouting.layout_networkx(graph=G, root_node=0)

nx.draw(G, pos=layout, with_labels=True)
```

Or define the tree purely in `WalkerLayouting` using unique keys:

```python
from walkerlayout import WalkerLayouting
#   0
#  /|\
# 1 2 3
# |   /\
# 4  5  6
#    |
#    7
tree = WalkerLayouting(root_key=0)
tree.add(parent_key=0, child_key=1)
tree.add(parent_key=0, child_key=3)
tree.add(parent_key=0, child_key=2, index=1)
tree.add(parent_key=3, child_key=6)
tree.add_from([(1,4), (3,5,0), (5, 7), (5, 8), (8, 9)]) # (parent, child [,index])
tree.remove(8)

layout = tree.get_layout()
# {
#  0: (0.0, 0.0), 
#  1: (-1.0, 1.0), 
#  2: (0.0, 1.0), 
#  3: (1.0, 1.0), 
#  4: (-1.0, 2.0), 
#  5: (0.5, 2.0), 
#  6: (1.5, 2.0), 
#  7: (0.5, 3.0)
# }
```

Keys can be of any type. However, you can type-hint them to a fixed type:

```python
tree: WalkerLayouting[str] = WalkerLayouting(root_key='root')
```
