### Schema Format <a name="schema"></a>
Below is an example of the schema format that defines the structure of the database, including the database name and tables with their respective attributes:
   1. **Schema Example**:
      ```
      {
          "database_name" : "ClassA1",
          "Tables" : [
              {
                  "name" : "student",
                  "columns" : ["First_name", "Last_name", "CGPA", "Gender", "Age"],
                  "primary_key"  : "Last_name",
                  "index_keys" : ["First_name", "Last_name", "CGPA"],
                  "overwrite" : "True",
             }
                      ]
       }
      ```
2. **Table Contents**:
  The schema format consists of the following elements for defining tables within the database:

      | Name | Type | Nullable | Notes |
      | ---- | ---- | -------- | ----- |
      | Name | string | No | Name of the table. |
      | Columns | List of Strings | No | List of column names, including the primary key. |
      | Primary_key | String | No | The primary key for the table. |
      | Index_key | List of Strings | Yes | List of column names that serve as index keys. |
      | Overwrite | boolean (true/false) | Yes | Initial value is 'false'; you can set its value to 'true' to enable overwriting.|
   
### Command-Line Interface <a name="commands"></a>

*Note: Ensure that you have a JSON file containing your schema before creating the database.*

| Command | Parameters | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `Create` | `DatabaseSchemaPath` | Creates a database following the specified [schema](#schema).
| `Set` | `DatabaseName`, `TableName`, `InputData` | Sets a row with the provided input data.
| `Get` | `DatabaseName`, `TableName`, `InputQuery` | Utilizes the input query to retrieve specific data from the database.
| `Delete` | `DatabaseName`, `TableName`, `InputQuery` | Uses the input query to delete specific data from the database.
| `Clear` | `DatabaseName` | Resets the specified database to its initial state.

This Command-Line Interface (CLI) provides a set of commands for creating, updating, querying, deleting data, and resetting databases, offering comprehensive control over your data management tasks.

## 4. Example Usage <a name="examples"></a>
- **The general format for any command in the program is as follows**:

   ```python
   python DataHive -c [command] [options]
   ```
   Replace `[command]` with the desired database command and `[options]` with relevant command options.

- **Commands Examples**:

    - Creating a new database:
         ```python
         python DataHive -c create -sc <your_schema_path>

                 # if you didn't add -q it will get all data in the table
         ```

    - Uses the input query to delete specific data from the database:
