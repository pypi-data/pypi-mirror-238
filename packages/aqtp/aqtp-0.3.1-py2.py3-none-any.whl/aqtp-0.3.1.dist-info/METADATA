# AQT : Accurate Quantized Training

AQT is a quantization library designed to allow utilization of
low-bit and high-performance numerics of contemporary ML hardware accelerators.
AQT supports both research and production[^research-vs-prod], but focuses on the latter.

[^research-vs-prod]: The support for research is exemplified by having a state of the art quantization quality on standard models such as ResNet and Transformer. The production aspect is defined as high performance and robust out-of-the-box working results with good defaults.
