This feature is related to:
*   FS_01_89_09_24 interp tre
*   FS_26_43_73_72 func tree

Repath tree allows overriding exiting tree path by another tree path
when current interp found a func (and, therefore, delegator) and selects next interp.

For example, it is used to continue completion from another part of the tree for functions like:
*   FS_43_50_57_71 `echo_args` func
*   FS_88_66_66_73 `intercept_invocation` func
