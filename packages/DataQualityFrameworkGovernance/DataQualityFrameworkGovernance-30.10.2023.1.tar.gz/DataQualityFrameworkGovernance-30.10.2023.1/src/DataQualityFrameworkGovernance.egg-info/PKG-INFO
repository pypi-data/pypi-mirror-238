# Data Quality Framework Governance (DQFG)

Data Quality Framework Governance is a structured approach to assessing, monitoring, and improving the quality of data. An effective Data Quality Framework considers these dimensions and integrates them into a structured approach to ensure that data serves its intended purpose, supports informed decision-making, and maintains the trust of users and stakeholders. It's an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring, assessment, and improvement to adapt to changing data requirements and evolving business needs.
