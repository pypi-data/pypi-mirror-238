whisper_autosrt is a command line utility for automatic speech recognition and subtitle generation  using faster_whisper module which is a reimplementation of OpenAI Whisper module. It takes video or audio files as input, generate transcriptions for them and optionally translates them to a differentlanguage, and finally saves the resulting subtitles file to disk.                                   It supports a variety of input and output languages and can currently produce subtitles in SRT, VTT,JSON, and RAW format.
