# Unofficial Client for Humanitec API

Based on generated client with swagger-codegen. Contains a few tweaks to tackle generation bugs from swagger-codegen. [Full generated documentation](src/README.md) of generated client.

This is for testing only. If you need to use a python-client in production, rather generate maintain one by yourself. 

However, if you just need a python module ready to access Humanitec API, run:

```
pip install unofficial-humanitec-client
```

# License

The original openapi specification is published under Apache 2 license. This generated client is published under EUROPEAN UNION PUBLIC LICENCE v. 1.2

# Trouble Shooting

## Authentication

Unfortunately, there is mix of missing security schemes in the original Humanitec specification (from version 0.24.1 on) and several bug in the swagger-codegen breaking the use of bearer authentication. As workaround use the folloying snippet:

```python
configuration = Configuration()
configuration.api_key['Authorization']='<your humanitec api token>'
configuration.api_key_prefix['Authorization']='Bearer'
api_client = swagger_client.ApiClient(configuration=configuration)
```

Use that api_client as base client for every api_instance you create, i.e.

```python
def get_all_apps(org_id: str):
    # Use api_client with bearer authentication configured
    api_instance = swagger_client.ApplicationApi(api_client=api_client)

    try:
        # List all Applications in an Organization.
        api_response = api_instance.orgs_org_id_apps_get(org_id)
        print(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling ApplicationApi->orgs_org_id_apps_get: %s\n" % e)
```

## Invalid value for '<some method>', must not be 'None'

Some endpoints cannot deal with null values. On the one side nullable fields are missing from the original Humanitec specification (0.24.1), but even when added, swagger-codegen still makes all fields required.

Known endpoints running in to this bug are `delta` endpoints. In that case, you have to rely on `reuests` module, which begs the question why using a generated client at all...
