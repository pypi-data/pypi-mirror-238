## Installation Instructions

It is recommended that you set up a conda environment using the included environment.yml folder.
See **Dependencies** below for more detail. You will have to activate the conda environment first each
time you want to run AniML from a new terminal.

```
git clone https://github.com/conservationtechlab/animl-py.git
cd animl-py
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate animl-gpu
pip install -e .
```

### From PyPi
```
conda create -n animl-gpu python=3.7
conda activate animl-gpu
conda install cudatoolkit=11.3.1 cudnn=8.2.1
pip install animl

```

### Dependencies
We recommend running AniML on GPU-enabled hardware. **If using an NVIDIA GPU, ensure driviers, cuda-toolkit and cudnn are installed.
The /models/ and /utils/ modules are from the YOLOv5 repository.  https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
