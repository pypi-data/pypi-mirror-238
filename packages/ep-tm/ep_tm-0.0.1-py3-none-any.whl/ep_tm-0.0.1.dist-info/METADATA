# Instructions

Complete [Activity 14: Python Packaging](https://classroom.github.com/a/V0uPkSQk) and have a Python package deployed on PyPi. The name of your package does not have to be "example-package" but it most end with your name. The package could do anything you like (not necessarily what is done in the tutorial). You need to push a file name **example.py** that illustrates a possible use of your package. 

# Grading

+3 I should be able to install your package using pip.
