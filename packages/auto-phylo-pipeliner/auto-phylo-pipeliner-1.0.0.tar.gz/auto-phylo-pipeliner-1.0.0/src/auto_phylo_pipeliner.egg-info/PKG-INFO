# auto-phylo-pipeliner

[auto-phylo](http://evolution6.i3s.up.pt/static/auto-phylo/v2/docs/) is a pipeline maker software for phylogenetic studies.

auto-phylo-pipeliner is a graphical user interface to rapidly create and modify pipelines for auto-phylo.

You can use [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pegi3s/auto-phylo-pipeliner/master/resources/run-docker.sh) to run the `pegi3s/auto-phylo-pipeliner` Docker image (the current working directory will be mounted and used as working directory in the new container).
