# Slitflow

**Slitflow** is a Python package that aims to construct a fully reproducible and universally accessible workflow for single-molecule analysisâ€”namely, **S**ingle-molecule **L**ocalization-**I**ntegrated **T**rajectory analysis work**FLOW**.

**Slitflow** comprises a flexible Data class that executes a task and stores the resulting data. A Data object can be input to the next Data object, the network of Data objects forming the entire workflow of complex single-molecule analysis, from image pre-processing to publication-quality figure creation.

**Slitflow** was designed by considering users who developed analysis tools, validated multiple analysis methods, reproduced workflows without programming skills, and used the results without installing software.

Please see [documentation](https://slitflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information about **Slitflow**.

## Installation
**Slitflow** can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/slitflow/).

```bash
pip install slitflow
```

## How to use

The simplest script to make an index table is as follows:

```Python
import slitflow as sf

D = sf.tbl.create.Index()
D.run([], {"type": "trajectory", "index_counts": [2, 2], "split_depth": 0})
print(D.data[0])
#  img_no  trj_no
#       1       1
#       1       2
#       2       1
#       2       2
```
Please see ["Getting Started Basic"](https://slitflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started_basic.html) to overview the functionality by analyzing the trajectories of simulated random walks.

["Getting Started Advanced"](https://slitflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started_advanced.html) demonstrated the integrity and flexibility of the workflow using 1) a cherry-picked tracking method combining popular tools and 2) various state-of-the-art analyses using [single-molecule movies](https://zenodo.org/record/7645485#.ZAWnix_P2Um).
