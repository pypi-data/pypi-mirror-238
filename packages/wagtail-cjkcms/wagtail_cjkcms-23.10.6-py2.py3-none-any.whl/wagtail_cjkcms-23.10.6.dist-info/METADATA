CMS system for Wagtail 4.x & 5.x, with support for Bootstrap/MDBootstrap 5.x. 

## Summary

Out of the box, CjkCMS provides your project with generic, reusable pages:
`[Project] ArticleIndex`, `[Project] Article`, `[Project] WebPage` which you can use in your project, or easily extend with additional functionality by defining new blocks from scratch, or installing any Wagtail application that defines new blocks. 

CjkCMS pages provide you with an ultra-flexible, generic "body" section and, using `wagtail-seo` package, a basic SEO functionality.
