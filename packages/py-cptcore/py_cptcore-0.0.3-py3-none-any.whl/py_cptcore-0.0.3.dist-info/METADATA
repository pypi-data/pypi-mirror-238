This repository is created by [CEMS BV](https://cemsbv.nl/) and is a public python wrapper around the CEMS [CPTCore web-API](https://nuclei.cemsbv.io/#/cptcore/api).

# Installation

To install a package in this repository run:

`$ pip install py-cptcore`


## ENV VARS

To use `py-cptcore` add the follow ENV vars to your environment. Or provide them when asked.

```
* NUCLEI_TOKEN
    - Your NUCLEI user token
```

You can obtain your `NUCLEI_TOKEN` on [NUCLEI](https://nuclei.cemsbv.io/#/). 
Go to `personal-access-tokens` and create a new user token.

# Contribution

## Environment

We recommend developing in Python3.9 with a clean virtual environment (using `virtualenv` or `conda`), installing the requirements from the requirements.txt file:

Example using `virtualenv` and `pip` to install the dependencies in a new environment .env on Linux:

```bash
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Documentation

Build the docs:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .

sphinx-build -b html docs public
```

## Format

We format our code with black and isort.

```bash
black --config "pyproject.toml" src/pycptcore tests 
isort --settings-path "pyproject.toml" src/pycptcore tests
```

## Lint

To maintain code quality we use the GitHub super-linter.

To run the linters locally, run the `run_super_linters.sh` bash script from the root directory.

## UnitTest

Test the software with the use of coverage:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
coverage run -m pytest
```

## Requirements

Requirements are autogenerated by the `pip-compile` command with python 3.9

Install pip-tools with:

```bash
pip install pip-tools
```

Generate requirements.txt file with:

```bash
pip-compile --extra=test --extra=lint --extra=docs --output-file=requirements.txt pyproject.toml
```

Update the requirements within the defined ranges with:

```bash
pip-compile --upgrade --extra=test --extra=lint --extra=docs --output-file=requirements.txt pyproject.toml
```
