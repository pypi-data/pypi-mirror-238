# pybrams

**pybrams** is a Python package that allows you to access information and data from the BRAMS (Belgian RAdio Meteor Stations) project. BRAMS is a network of radio receiving stations that use forward scattering techniques to study the meteoroid population. This project, coordinated by the Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy (BISA), provides a valuable source of data for researchers, amateur astronomers, and meteor enthusiasts.

## Features

- Fetch detailed information about BRAMS stations, including their location, name, number of antennas, and more.
- Retrieve raw data files in WAV format, which can be used for in-depth analysis of meteoroid activity.
- Access PNG images representing spectrograms, making it easy to visualize meteoroid detections.

## Installation

You can install **pybrams** using pip:

pip install pybrams


## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use **pybrams** to retrieve station information:

```python
from brams import locations
import json

for location in locations.all():

    json.dumps(location, indent = 4)
```
