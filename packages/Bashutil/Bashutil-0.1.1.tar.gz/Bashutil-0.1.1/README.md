## Version Syntax:

Example: 1.5.6

The 1 is a "mega version". Bascially every update of "1" will be a massive update.

The "5" is a standard version. Every normal update will increase that number.

The "6" is a bug fixing number. Any bugs that are fixed in that version will update the number.
