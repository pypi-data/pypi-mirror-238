## New FakesUsers 3.0
On October 30, FakesUsers 3.0 was released, a more technologically advanced version 2.1. What's new in FakesUsers 3.0?

1) New generation of email addresses

more about her later
3) Fixed Bag

## Import
In order to import the library, you need to install it :)
Enter the cmd command to install this library
```sh
pip install FakesUsers
```
After that, in your file with the .py extension, write . . .
```sh
from FakesUsers import Fu
fu = Fu()
```

## Basic Concept
What commands are there in this library? This library has commands such as:
Selecting a language for generation
```sh
genRegion()
```

Displaying a random male name
```sh
fakename_male()
```

Displaying a random female name
```sh
fakename_female()
```

Displaying a random phone number
```sh
fake_number()
```

Displaying a random addres
```sh
fake_addres()
```

And displaying a random email
```sh
fake_email()
```

## Theory about library functions
genRegion('ru/en') - Selecting a language for generation
fakename_male() - Generating a random male name
fakename_female() - Generating a random female name
fake_number() - Generating a random phone number
fake_addres() - Generating a random addres
fake_email() - Generating a random email


## Example Code
Let's look at a simple code that will output a random man's and woman's name, phone number and address
Code
```sh
from FakesUsers import Fu

fu = Fu()

print(fu.fakename_male())
print(fu.fakename_female())
print(fu.fakenumber())
print(fu.fakeaddres())
```
Result (Translation from Russian)
```sh

Elizaveta Yarkova
