# Slot Machine Game

A simple Python-based slot machine game.

## Overview

This project is a basic implementation of a slot machine game in Python. Players can deposit a certain amount of money, choose the number of lines to bet on, and place bets within a specified range. The game then simulates the spinning of wheels with different symbols and checks for winning combinations. Players can win or lose, and their balance is adjusted accordingly.

## How to Play

Follow these steps to play the slot machine game:

1. **Deposit**: Enter the total amount you want to deposit into the game. The minimum deposit amount is Rs 100. This initial deposit sets your starting balance.

2. **Number of Lines**: Choose the number of lines you want to bet on. You can select between 1 and 3 lines.

3. **Bet Amount**: Enter the total amount you want to bet per line. The bet amount should be within the range of Rs 10 to Rs 100.

4. **Spin the Wheels**: The game will simulate the spinning of the wheels with various symbols.

5. **Check for Winnings**: The game will check for winning combinations on the selected lines. If you have a winning combination, your winnings will be calculated based on the symbols and your bet amount.

6. **Adjust Balance**: Your balance will be adjusted based on the outcome of the game. If you win, your balance increases; if you lose, it decreases.

7. **Repeat or Quit**: You can choose to play another round by pressing Enter or quit the game by typing 'q'.
