# PyPi-installer

PyPi-installer is a dynamic package installer in Python that allows you to easily install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI). It provides a convenient way to manage dependencies and install packages directly in pure Python. With PyPi-installer, you can easily install, upgrade, and remove packages with just a few simple functions with package managers like conda and pip.

To use PyPi-installer, you need to have Python and pip installed on your system. Once you have those dependencies set up, you can install PyPi-installer itself by running the following command: `pip install pypi-installer`. Or you can clone repository from GitHub.

Then use:
```python
import pypi_installer as ppi


ppi.install("pyqt6")
```

All functions in my module:
+ `install(lib: str, auto_import: Union[str, bool] = False, manager: Literal["poetry", "conda", "pip"] = "pip")` — install `lib` from manager `manager` as `auto_import`.
+ `uninstall(lib: str, manager: Literal["poetry", "pip", "conda"])` — uninstall `lib`.
+ `import_all(sd: bool = False)` — import all files from the root. If `sd` is true, then import all files from the subdirs too.
+ `all` — a variable with all useful packages.
+ `venv()` — initialize venv.
