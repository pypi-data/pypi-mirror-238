Description: # PyPi-installer
        
        PyPi-installer is a dynamic package installer in Python that allows you to easily install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI). It provides a convenient way to manage dependencies and install packages directly in pure Python. With PyPi-installer, you can easily install, upgrade, and remove packages with just a few simple functions with package managers like conda and pip.
        
        To use PyPi-installer, you need to have Python and pip installed on your system. Once you have those dependencies set up, you can install PyPi-installer itself by running the following command: `pip install pypi-installer`. Or you can clone repository from GitHub.
        
        Then use:
        ```python
        import pypi_installer as ppi
        
        
        ppi.install("pyqt6")
        ```
        
        All functions in my module:
        + `install(lib: str, auto_import: Union[str, bool] = False, manager: Literal["poetry", "conda", "pip"] = "pip")` — install `lib` from manager `manager` as `auto_import`.
        + `uninstall(lib: str, manager: Literal["poetry", "pip", "conda"])` — uninstall `lib`.
        + `import_all(sd: bool = False)` — import all files from the root. If `sd` is true, then import all files from the subdirs too.
        + `all` — a variable with all useful packages.
        + `venv()` — initialize venv.
