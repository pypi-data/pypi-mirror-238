    Support for Qiskit Nature 0.5.

  - |
    Support for Qiskit Nature < 0.5 has been removed upon this release.

    Users are now be required to use the :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.ElectronicStructureProblem`,
    as input to the :class:`EntanglementForgingGroundStateSolver`, rather than the deprecated :class:`~qiskit_nature.problems.second_quantization.ElectronicStructureProblem`.

    For more information on migrating to Qiskit Nature 0.5, check out the
    `Qiskit Nature migration guide <https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/nature/migration/0.5_a_intro.html>`_.

    For more information on adapting your entanglement forging workflows, check
    out the :ref:`tutorials <Forging tutorials>` and :ref:`how-to guides <Forging how-tos>`.

    The :class:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.utils.IntegralDriver` class has been removed. The new Qiskit Nature
    API allows for a more flexible build-up of the :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.ElectronicStructureProblem`,
    and this driver is no longer needed.
