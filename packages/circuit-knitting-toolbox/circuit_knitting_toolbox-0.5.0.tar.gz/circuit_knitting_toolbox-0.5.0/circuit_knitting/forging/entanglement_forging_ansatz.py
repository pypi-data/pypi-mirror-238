class EntanglementForgingAnsatz:
    """Class to hold features of the ansatz for Entanglement Forging.

    Entanglement Forging is based on a Schmidt decomposition of a 2N-qubit
    wavefunction into two N-qubit subsystems. These subsystems are described by a
    unitary operator U acting on a set of computational basis states. The unitary
    can be represented by a parametrized quantum circuit whose parameters are
    optimized using a VQE. The computational basis states of each subsystem that
    contribute to the Schmidt decomposition can be specified by a list of
    bitstrings. This list can be chosen differently for each subsystem.

    For a 2N-qubit operator, the circuit should act on N qubits and the bitstrings
    should be of length N. This class functions as a container for information about
    the circuit and bitstrings, and is required for the EntanglementForgingGroundStateSolver.
