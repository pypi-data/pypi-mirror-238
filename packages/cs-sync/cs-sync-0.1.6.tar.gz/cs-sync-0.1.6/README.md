# Descriptions

A custom syncing tool. Originally used to simply tasks such as checking on my local Git repositories and syncing to my Taskwarrior server. May someday add S3 support.

# Installation

PyPi - The Python Package Index

`pip install cs-sync`

## Current Support

- Git
  - **Works with bare repos**
- Taskwarrior

# Usage

Uses async operations, alongside package such as Click (what Typer is built upon) and blessed to create a pleasant experience checking on your local repos and syncing your tasks with your Taskwarrior server.

The default is to check your config file, located at `~/.cssync`, and load up your configuration details. If this is not the case, then it will use reasonable defaults for your local configuration.

## Git

`cs-sync git`
: Pulls on all repositories.
: Shows Repo `name` (actually folder name), branch, diff information, diff files (added, deleted, changes, etc.).

`--short`
: Won't show the repos that are up to date.

## Taskwarrior

`cs-sync tasks`
: Simply runs `task sync` to sync your tasks with your Taskwarrior server.

# Example .cssync file

```yaml
repo_paths:
  - ~/Development/*
  - ~/vimfiles
  - ~/wiki
  - ~/Work
  - ~/.git-hooks
bare_repos:
  - name: Dotfiles
    git_dir: ~/.dotfiles
    work_tree: ~/
```
